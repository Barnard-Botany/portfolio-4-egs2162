## Review: mapping data from BIEN

```{r}
#Just to review, let's recall how we can download data from BIEN
#We'll do that for several species in a genus from Latin America, Jungia 
#We can get occurrence data and also species range models

# get occurance data out of bien
J_paniculata <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia paniculata")
J_pauciflora <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia pauciflora")
J_polita <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia polita")

# get rangemeap
J_paniculata_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia paniculata")
J_pauciflora_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia pauciflora")
J_polita_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia polita")

# Both can be mapped, for example: 
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35), ylim=c(-40,12))
plot(J_pauciflora_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
```

```{r}
# Map another Jungia species
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
plot(J_polita_rangemap, col="red", add=T)
```

```{r}
# And a third Jungia
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
plot(J_paniculata_rangemap, col="blue", add=T)
```

```{r}
# Map occurence records for three species of Jungia
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
points(cbind(J_pauciflora$longitude, J_pauciflora$latitude), col="red", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(J_paniculata$longitude, J_paniculata$latitude), col="blue", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(J_polita$longitude, J_polita$latitude), col="green", pch=20, cex=.8)

# ponits formatted as (x,y) with at long and lat using the points() function
```

## Combining occurrence data and climate data

Mapping occurrence data is informative for discerning species ranges overlap. But could we add  more information, such as how each species overlaps with climate variables?. 

Of course we can, by tapping into the worldclim data base: http://www.worldclim.org/

Peruse their on-line resource, where it's possible to obtain data for past and future climate based on various climate models.

There are a lot of details here, but important to know that the temperature data are in degrees C times 10. The unit for precipitation data is millimeters, and for altitude is meters. 

```{r}
# data from worldclim data base / alt = altitue; bio = temperature?

all.worldclim <- raster::getData("worldclim", res = 10, var = "bio") # big zipfile of data
all.worldalt <- raster::getData("worldclim", res = 10, var = "alt")
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]]) # diff version than below (temp)
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]])
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]]) # (alt)
```

Climate data can be combined with occurrence data downloaded from BIEN, or any geo-coded data.

Below are three examples:
first with a temperature variable
next with a precipitation variable
lastly with topographic elevation as the variable ("altitude")

```{r}
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]]) # temperature plot
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 24, cex = 0.5) # adding rangemap ontop
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]]) # precip
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]]) # altitude - topographic map
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")

```


```{r}
#To change the spatial extent (i.e. "zoom in"), re-set limits with "xlim" and "ylim" 
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]], xlim=c(-10,4),ylim=c(35,45))

# spain - much like a peninsula (surrounded by water on all sides, etc.) >> high rates of endimism
```


```{r}
#Or try the command "crop" with an argument to "extent" 
#four numbers are required: the xlim numbers first (west and east longitude)
#followed by the ylim numbers next (south and north latitude)
peninsula.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-10, 4, 35, 45))
plot(peninsula.worldclim[["bio1"]])
#You can get latitudes and longitudes from mP, whether a published paper map or Google maps. 
# reolustions appear about the same (grainy) - because downloaded at low resolution
# temperature data 

# note on tempearture units on maps (to avoid decimals): 30.3 C => 303 on map
```

#### Mini-Exercise #1 

Answer the questions about this peninsula example. Then do your own example from Latin America:
1. Where in the world is the peninsula mapped above?
# A: Spain/Portugal
2. Is altitude a climate variable? How do the peninsula maps plotted above support your answer?
# No: (my opinion) althrough altitude readily effects the climate of a region and changes from area to area, it does not change on the temopral scale that climtate data does. As can be observed in the comands generating maps other climate variables (ie. temperature and precipitation) altitude is not included in the world climate data. For example, generating precipitaion data comes from ".worldclim[["bio12"]])", but elevation data comes from ".worldalt[["alt"]])". The different databases they come from (worldclim vs worldalt) confirms this notion.
# Yes: in class we say yes: a geological variable, and instructive of evolution. They do change over time (just more slowly) in mountain building processes. Logic in this determination lies in the fact that climate changes over area as altitude does.
3. Make a South America map with occurrence data for Jungia pauciflora & J. polita and:
          a. Crop the map to allow discerning more detail in the two ranges
          b. Also include altitude data or climate data, with occurrence points overlayed.
          # done for climate (precipiation) data



```{r}
# Mini-Exercise #1 Part 3
#Trimming data to match South American region
SAmerica.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-75, -50, -20, -5)) # shifted up and over

# plotting precipitation
plot(SAmerica.worldclim[["bio12"]])

#Superimposing data
#Occurrence data overlays
points(cbind(J_pauciflora$longitude, J_pauciflora$latitude), col="red", pch=20, cex=.8)
#points(cbind(J_paniculata$longitude, J_paniculata$latitude), col="blue", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(J_polita$longitude, J_polita$latitude), col="white", pch=20, cex=.8)
#plot(SAmerica.worldclim[["alt"]])

```



## More occurrence data

BIEN is not the only database for getting species occurrence data. We've used it because it has already been thoroughly filtered to ensure that it uses correct species names, which it does by using (in the background) an R package called "taxize" that you can install and load and use. 

We're going to explore "taxize" a bit, then use the specific tool "rgbif" and then "spocc"

IMPORTANT: Many of the functions in "taxize" are interactive, and you often will need to interact through the console window (below) rather than work completely in this Notebook. That's true for the example below:

# new idea: plants to have barcodes and ID#s instead of names 
# so each rank (DKPCOFGS) with different serial number 



```{r}
library("rgbif") # part of r open science suite; species occurence data
library("spocc")
library("taxize") # part of r open science suite; online taxonomic bases

#Sometimes you know the species name, but you may be a little unsure of the spelling 
# taxize package to do this 
results=gnr_resolve(names="Heirochloe odorata") # here spelled wrong 
head(results$matched_name)
results=gnr_resolve(names="Solanum pimpinelifolia")
head(results$matched_name)
results=gnr_resolve(names="Sequoiadendron gigantium")
head(results$matched_name)

# for each line of code (each name), a list of species is generated of possible species to match it (for correct spelling)
```


```{r}
#Now that we have the correct spelling, 
#Another thing to check is whether the name is accepted, or perhaps a synonym
#Believe it or not, scientific names for organisms have corresponding serial numbers
#These are called taxonomic serial numbers, and you can look them up with taxize
#which, in turn, interfaces something called the Integrated Taxonomic Information System 
#https://www.itis.gov/pdf/faq_itis_tsn.pdf

#The query is interactive, so look in the console and choose the taxon of interest
name="Hierochloe odorata"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn

#The output suggests checking the it is database for the accepted name
# this returns the used name (here Anthoxanthum nitens) for the serial number we got earlier from its synonym
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname) 

# cleaning/scrubbing and get list of common names
# entered "1" when prompted in console (Q: More than one TSN found for taxon 'Hierochloe odorata'!Enter rownumber of taxon (other inputs will return 'NA'):)

# if more than 1 serial number for what you sumbitted, will ask what you want (usualy answering 1 is okay)
```

```{r}
# now lets classify it (sweetgrass)!

#Another potentally useful tasks include looking for higher level taxonomy
#In other words, how can you tell if a scientific name of a plant is an angiosperm?
#How can you find out what family it belongs to?
#A variety of tools are useful and you can look at one species, or multiple.
#The example below looks at two species. 
#Potentially you could read in a dataframe from elsewhere (csv file, for example).
#And you could submit the variable species names are stored
classification(c("Metasequoia glyptostroboides", "Sequoiadendron giganteum"), db="itis")

# gets data for first species then the next 
# then geneates list of each taxon level and tame 
```

```{r}
#Here's another way to do that, in another database
tax_name(q="Solanum pimpinellifolium", get="family", db="ncbi")

# doesnt seem to work; says: "No ENTREZ API key provided"
```

```{r}
#If you wanted to know all the genera in a family, or all species in a genus, 
#then you're referring to taxa "downstream"

downstream("Cupressaceae", downto="species", db="itis")

# gets all data on Cupressaceae
```

```{r}
#if you just want exactly one taxonomic rank lower, then this is referred to as "children"
#Here, because Catalogue of Life can and will be queried INTERACTIVELY, 
#you need to look at the console to choose the correct taxon of interest
#INTERACTIVE feature will require you to go to the console to scroll and select suggestions
children("Solanum", db="col")

# retrievs data for taxon 'Solanum'(shows all data within Solanum)
# 4,436 rows
```


```{r}

#Other useful name-related functions in gbif:
name_lookup(q="Hierochloe odorata") # gives list of numbers (ID codes?)
name_backbone(name="Metasequoia glyptostroboides") # generates list of information
name_usage(5937158) # just outputs "$meta $data": based on this ID number, what names are connected to it 
```

## Querying the GBIF database (aggregate of other datasets)

To obtain data throught the GBIF database, taxonomy is important, and you might want to work with the package "taxize" before starting, but GBIF also has a lot of its own utilities for taxonomy built into an R package called "rgbif"

And, beyond rgbif, there are other database-specific packages like "rebird" for the Citizen Science app and database E-bird and "rinat" for working with I-Naturalist. 

These were created by a project called R-OpenSci, which also has a package called "spocc" that can query multiple databases at the same time. 

And, generally, data from such databases needs to be "cleaned" in a number of ways, for which you will need a package called "scrubr". These packages for digital natural history and biodiversity science were created and are maintained by Scott Chamberlain, who works for R-OpenSci.


Let's first focus just on one of the more comprehensive databases, GBIF. 

```{r}
library(rgbif)
#We are going to do a few things here
#First, if you look in the RGBIF documentation, you can find all the values that can be included with the argument "RecordTypes" -- I put them into a vector with the command below:


RecordTypes <- c('HUMAN_OBSERVATION', 'FOSSIL_SPECIMEN', 'LITERATURE', 'LIVING_SPECIMEN', 'MACHINE_OBSERVATION', 'OBSERVATION', 'PRESERVED_SPECIMEN', 'UNKNOWN')
RecordTypes

#There are other things you can do, like looking for records from a given year, which could obviously be combined with Record Types. 

#You see that we have eight types of records. 
#Now, we could look at all eight of these one by one using this command
obs <- occ_count(basisOfRecord = 'HUMAN_OBSERVATION')
obs # outputs: "858740982" for HUMAN_OBSERVATION >> number of human observations there are ?

```



```{r}
#Or, we could use a for loop, which will re-iterate the same command over and over again but each time changing the input to the command.

#In R, loops starts with an open bracket sign, 
#Then, the command must define where to find the values in each iteration of the loop
#An example loop is in the chunk below, using the vector RecordTypes, defined above

#Look up and get counts for each record type
for (i in RecordTypes) {
type=i
obs <- occ_count(basisOfRecord = i)
print(c(type, obs))
}
```




Here's another example of a loop, counting records from different years. 

What does the output tell us about dates in the GBIF database?  
# observations as a dataframe are "tidy"
# output shows how many counts (observations) there are for each year

```{r}
#Here are all the years I want to look up
Years <- c("1599", "1600", "1601", "1619", "1659", "1699", "1700", "1701", "1719", "1759", "1799", "1800", "1801", "1809", "1819", "1829", "1839", "1849", "1859", "1869", "1879", "1889", "1899", "1900", "1903", "1953", "2000", "2003", "2017", "2018")

#Here, I'm making an EMPTY vector for all the occurrence counts that I get out of 
obs <- NULL

#Now, starting a "for loop" to query  GBIF to count  occurrences in each of the years 
# filling 'obs'
for (i in Years) {
obs[i] <- occ_count(year=i)
}

#loop is finished
obs
#This gives output awkwardly, as  two vectors (year placed above value), reading across two rows

(obs <- as.data.frame(obs))
#This gives output in a better format: dataframe puts years in a left-most column as Row Names, and then in the next column each cell as occurrence counts for each year, reading down.
# also ordered 
```


Let's go back to our peninsula, which is a hotspot of endemism for many plant and animal species. Remember to load the R Package "rgbif".

```{r}
library(rgbif)

Spergularia <- occ_search(scientificName="Spergularia melanocaulos", limit=1000)
#head(Spergularia)

colnames(Spergularia$data)
#Spergularia$data$genus
#Spergularia$data$species
unique(Spergularia$data$genus) # tells of all unique genera in data (here only one)
unique(Spergularia$data$species) # tells of all unique species in data (here only one)
```

# trim it down and clean it (whole data set ^) up: 

Very good habit to trim the default data downloaded to be smaller, and make sure it's a data frame. Also make sure you have only complete cases because some of the code below will choke if there are missing values. Also, sometimes the same individual plant/population will be recorded at multiples times in the same location, which is why you may want to run the "unique" commands. The "dim" command helps you look at how you trimmed down the file.


```{r}
#Choose just three variables (trim all but there variables)
Spergularia.small <- subset(Spergularia$data, select=c("species", "decimalLatitude",
"decimalLongitude")) # were making a map, so we teak lat, long, and species 

#Rename the columns, make sure you're working with a dataframe
colnames(Spergularia.small) <- c("species", "lat", "lon")
Spergularia.small <- as.data.frame(Spergularia.small) # make into a dataframe ?
head(Spergularia.small)
tail(Spergularia.small)

#There are often occurrences with missing values to remove 
dim(Spergularia.small)
Spergularia.small <- Spergularia.small[complete.cases(Spergularia.small),]
dim(Spergularia.small)

#Also there may be duplicates, the same plant or population observed twice
#Or uploaded twice into the database
Spergularia.u <- unique(Spergularia.small) 
dim(Spergularia.u) # 25 uniquely observed instances with lat and long
```



#Working instead with the package "spocc" (species occurance)

This package is great for working with GBIF or other databases. 

```{r}
#We can look up a species (here from GBIF); occ() function to just get simole occurence data
DawnRedwood <- occ(q="Metasequoia glyptostroboides", from="gbif", limit=50)
DawnRedwood

#By default spocc will return a sample of just 500 observations
#Here, to speed things up during class, I've further limited to just 50 records
#Even though we can see there are 1688 occurrences in the database
#Also, looking in "Environment" in the upper right, we can see that 
#this is not a dataframe. It is a new type of object "Large occdat" which has 10 elements
#One of those elements is data
#We can ask for at data using this format
DawnRedwood.dat <- (DawnRedwood$gbif$data)
head(DawnRedwood.dat)
#But that gives ALL the fields. 
#A nifty function called occ2df gives just some essential data
#It's nifty that the package "spocc" converts this huge result into a slimmed down dataframe
DawnRedwood.df <- occ2df(DawnRedwood) # occurence data to a dataframe 
DawnRedwood.df

#You can see that there are some occurrence records that lack longitude and latitude
#Then you can exclude them
dim(DawnRedwood.df) # gives dimesions
DawnRedwood.df <- DawnRedwood.df[complete.cases(DawnRedwood.df),]
dim(DawnRedwood.df) # trimmed 5 off
DawnRedwood.df
#You should see that six of our 50 lines were left out
```

```{r}
#Check out idigbio (same code but for generating data, "from= " command with diff database)
GiantRedwood.digbio <- occ(q="Sequoia giganteum", from="idigbio", limit=50)
GiantRedwood.digbio <- occ2df(GiantRedwood.digbio)
GiantRedwood.digbio
GiantRedwood.digbio <- GiantRedwood.digbio[complete.cases(GiantRedwood.digbio),]
dim(GiantRedwood.digbio)
GiantRedwood.digbio
```



## Mini-exercise #2

Let's build and combine your new skills in looking up species occurrence data with what we learned about mapping. 

Going back to our peninsula, here are a bunch of species that are endemic to that area.

Spergularia melanocaulos
Petrocoptis grandiflora
Spergula viscosa
Minuartia cerastiifolia
Minuartia recurva
Petrocoptis hispanica
Petrocoptis pyrenaica

Choose any two, and do the following:

WORK WITH TAXISE
1. Look up - are they accepted names or are they synonyms? # one of each 
2. Look up the two plant taxa. Are they both angiosperms? # yes
3. Angiosperm or otherwise, what plant family do they belong to? # Poaceae and Juglandaceae
4. For at least one genus, look up all the species in that genus.
5. For one species, look up to see if there are subspecies or other infraspecific forms.

WORK WITH RGBIF OR SPOCC
6. For both, search and download species occurrence data; prepare as a data-frame
7. Clean-up the data-frame:  remove occurrences with missing data and duplicates


WORK WITH OCCURRENCE DATA, WORLDCLIM DATA AND MAPS
8. Map occurrence data with a climate variable for one species on the peninsula
9. Also map that species with climate variables on a world map or European map. Are you convinced that the species is endemic to this peninsula? # DEFINITELY neither are endemic to the peninsula, but this was more or less known before plotting the data
10. Returning to your results for #4 above, find another species with a range outside of the  peninsula. Download occurrence data and map on a world map. 
11. Then re-map on an appropriately cropped map.

ONE LAST THING
12. Don't forget to identify the peninsula that we are working with! # Iberian

# MASTERY ASSIGNMENT   
```{r}

# in this .Rmd we:
# - collecect central park (area) data
# - clean occurance lists for [GBIF, Atha, Street Census]
# - create abundance matrix comparing central park data (GBIF, Atha)
# - create abundance matrix comparing area and perimiter data (central park, street trees)
# - run the learned biodiversity statistics: between Atha/GBIF; between CP/Street

# Questions/TO DO
# - should I separate parts of code into seperate code chunks - using ``` {r} ?
# - could: create file of biodiveristy stats to print out (or could just copy and paste)
